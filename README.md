# FiRe
(Fi)re (Re)scue is the project where we use the data collected from NASA satellite as where the currently Wildfires have started and we use those co-ordinates to Geocode it to an address and retrieve the Phone Numbers of all the Fire Stations which are near to that co-ordinates by Web Scraping.

To Run the code three of the following things should be followed:
 !1.Create an empty .txt file called WebPage which will be used for WebScraping
 !2.ARCGIS is not a necessity for the code to run and is just used to show the map. If you need to un ARCGIS get username and password from ARCGIS website.
 !3.Add the city codes for which country you'll be running the program for.


This is the link where you can get the report of last 24 hours of wildfire: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/#firms-txt
!There are 2 satellites (MODIS and VIIRS) you can use anyone of the data collected in the form of CSV and use it in here.
